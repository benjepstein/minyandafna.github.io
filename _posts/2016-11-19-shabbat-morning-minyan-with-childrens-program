This year – once a month Minyan Dafna will have childrens programming.

A few things to know:
- We are expecting this will be a lively Shabbat morning davening, with the buzz of children in the background.
- Children will be expected to be with their parents in Tfillot until the second Aliyah of the Torah, at which point kids can go outside to the park for supervised play. (we’d ask that kids ages 0-5 go outside with a parent or guardian)
- There will be a 30 minute guided Parsha related activity for the kids from 11:30 -12.

Davening will be followed by a special kiddush. Please email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org) if you have any questions about this service.
