Minyan Dafna is piloting an additional Shabbat morning davening in March, which will feature children's programming by Elana Naftalin-Kelman. As always, our services are open to everyone.

Davening will be followed by a special kiddush. Please email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org) if you have any questions about this pilot.
