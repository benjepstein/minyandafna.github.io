We are excited to welcome Rabbi Dr. Zev Farber as our special guest for our Shabbat celebration this month! 

Zev will speak following dinner about **"How Matzah Took Over Pesach"**.

Rabbi Dr. Zev Farber holds an M.A. from Hebrew University in Jewish History (biblical period) and Ph.D. from Emory University in Jewish Religious Cultures. His focus was on Bible and biblical reception and his dissertation, titled Images of Joshua, deals with the development of the Joshua story and the reception of his character in post-biblical cultures. In addition to academic training, Zev holds ordination (yoreh yoreh) and advanced ordination (yadin yadin) from Yeshivat Chovevei Torah (YCT) Rabbinical School. He was a founding board member of the International Rabbinic Fellowship (IRF) and is the editor of Yeshivat Maharat’s journal, Keren. Zev’s edited volumes on brain death and organ donation are forthcoming from Koren. Zev blogs actively at Morethodoxy and Times of Israel, and answers questions for Jewish Values Online.
