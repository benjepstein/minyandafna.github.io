Minyan Dafna will be holding spirited and songful Yamim Noraim (High Holidays) services again this year in Berkeley. This year, we are delighted that Rabbi Maya Resnikoff will be joining us as our Rabbi in Residence for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur.

We will be meeting in the Upstairs Meeting Room at Finnish Hall located at 1970 Chestnut St. Join us for spirited traditional egalitarian davening led by members of our growing community.

If you would like to participate in the services, read Torah, or volunteer in any other way, please email highholidays@minyandafna.org.
