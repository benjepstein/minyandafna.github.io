Minyan Dafna is excited to be organizing a Megillah reading on Purim day. It will be in the early afternoon, so if you're planning on sleeping in, then this is the reading for you!

Light refreshments to follow the reading. [Let us know](mailto:leyning@minyandafna.org) if you'd like to read a perek of Megillah!
