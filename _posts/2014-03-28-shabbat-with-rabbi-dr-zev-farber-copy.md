Please join us for our traditional egalitarian Shabbat morning service. We will be meeting in a second-floor classroom in the Netivot Shalom building.

Davening will be followed by kiddush. Looking forward to seeing you there. Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](javascript:void&#40;location.href=)

_Kiddush sponsored by [Moishe House Without Walls](http://www.mhwow.org)_.
