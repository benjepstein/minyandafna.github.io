		          <p>Minyan Dafna is an independent traditional egalitarian minyan in Berkeley, California. We come together for one Kabbalat Shabbat and one Shabbat Morning davening per month. Through some experimention with different models of davening and learning, we are creating a vibrant, energetic, and inclusive community committed to <i>halakha</i>.</p>
              <p> As this minyan is in its beginning stages, we are actively reaching out for ideas, suggestions, and feedback. If youâ€™d like to contribute with your opinion, time, or in any other way, please let us know. We are excited about your involvement and about growing this prayer community together!</p>

              <p>Minyan Dafna is grateful for the support of the <a href="http://www.mechonhadar.org/alumni/microgrants/2014">Yeshivat Hadar Alumni Microgrant Fund</a> and the <a href="http://www.bronfman.org/alumniventurefund">Bronfman Alumni Venture Fund</a>, and <a href="http://www.mhwow.org">Moishe House Without Walls</a>.</p>
