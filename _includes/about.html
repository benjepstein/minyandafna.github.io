		          <p>We are an independent traditional egalitarian minyan in Berkeley, California. We aim to host one Kabbalat Shabbat and one Saturday morning davening per month. We plan to experiment with different models of davening and learning. We hope to create a vibrant, energetic, and inclusive community committed to <i>halakha</i>.</p>
              <p> As this minyan is in its infancy, we are actively reaching out for ideas, suggestions, and feedback. If youâ€™d like to contribute with your opinion, time, or in any other way, please let us know. We are excited about your involvement and about growing this prayer community together.</p>

              <p>Minyan Dafna is grateful for the support of the <a href="http://www.mechonhadar.org/alumni/microgrants/2014">Yeshivat Hadar Alumni Microgrant Fund</a> and the <a href="http://www.bronfman.org/alumniventurefund">Bronfman Alumni Venture Fund</a>, and <a href="http://www.mhwow.org">Moishe House Without Walls</a>.</p>
