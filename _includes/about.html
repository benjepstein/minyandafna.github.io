<!--                <h3>Explanation of Kashrut Policy</h3>-->
                <p>Kehilat Hadar has a kashrut policy because members of our community have different standards of kashrut in their homes. In an effort to accommodate all members of our community, we ask that all food for community events, such as Lunch and Learns and meals hosted in your home as part of a Kehilat Hadar program, be prepared in a kosher kitchen, and that ingredients for the meal (including cheese) be marked with a recognized kosher symbol (more than just "K"). Whether you attend a meal or host a meal, all food bought or made should follow this policy. If you have any questions, including how to meet these kashrut standards, please <a href="#contact">contact us</a>.
