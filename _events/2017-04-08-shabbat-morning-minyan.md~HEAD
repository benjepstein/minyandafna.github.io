Please join us for our traditional egalitarian Shabbat morning service. We will be meeting in the Art Room upstairs in the Netivot Shalom building.

*Please note that the date has changed. We are now meeting on 4/8 (not 4/1).*

Davening will be followed by kiddush. Looking forward to seeing you there. Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)
