Please join us for our traditional egalitarian Shabbat morning service. We will be celebrating this Shabbat the Aufrauf of Brian and Lisa. Please note that we are meeting at Finnish Hall, not Netivot Shalom.

Davening will be followed by a light kiddush lunch. Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](mailto:info@minyandafna.org)
