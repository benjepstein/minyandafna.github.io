We're meeting two weeks in a row in July! Join us for another installment of spirited traditional egalitarian davening. We will meet at Netivot Shalom in the Art Room. Davening will be followed by a kiddush and home hospitality is available for Shabbat lunch. 

Looking forward to seeing you there. Please let us know if you have any questions - email [info at minyandafna . org](javascript:void&#40;location.href=)
