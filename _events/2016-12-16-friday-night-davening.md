Minyan Dafna's partnership with Studio 70/[Edah](http://www.edahcommunity.org) continues for another Friday night davening! Join us for davening and a potluck this Friday night!

7:45 pm: Potluck dinner at Nehama's apartment in Berkeley (RSVP for address). 

Walk over with us after davening — if you are coming later, yell up to be let into Nehama's apartment.

Please bring something hechsher kosher (dairy/vegetarian meal) to the potluck — if you don't have a kosher kitchen, something store-bought with a hechsher is great! If coming from outside the eruv, you can drop off at Nehama's between 2-4 pm on Friday. 

Looking forward to bringing in Shabbat with community, singing, and food!
